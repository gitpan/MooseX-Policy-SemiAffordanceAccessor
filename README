NAME
    MooseX::Policy::SemiAffordanceAccessor - A policy to name accessors
    foo() and set_foo()

SYNOPSIS
        use Moose::Policy 'MooseX::Policy::SemiAffordanceAccessor';
        use Moose;

        # make some attributes

DESCRIPTION
    This class does not provide any methods. Just loading it changes the
    default naming policy for the package so that accessors are separated
    into get and set methods. The get methods have the same name as the
    accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "set_".

    If you define an attribute with a leading underscore, then the set
    method will start with "_set_".

    If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name when creating an
    attribute, then this policy skips that attribute.

    The name "semi-affordance" comes from David Wheeler's Class::Meta
    module.
